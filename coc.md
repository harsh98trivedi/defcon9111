At the event, you are most welcomed to participate in every sort of activities stated that it doesn't cause ruckus. Your radical viewpoint and questioning attitude will be highly welcomed. 
We DO NOT condone harassment against any participant, for any reason. Harassment includes deliberate intimidation and targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We and the venue security will respond to harassment in the manner we deem appropriate, including but not limited to expulsion from the event with the surety that you don't show up at any following events we conduct.

This Code of Conduct applies to everyone participating at DEF CON Delhi Group (DC9111) events - **from attendees and exhibitors to speakers, press, volunteers, and Goons.**

Anyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact a Goon, go to the registration desk, or info booth.
